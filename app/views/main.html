    <h1>Welcome to BodiesByBean, your home for ultra-realistic lexan R/C body painting.</h1>
    <p>Almost every part, of every body, that I produce is painted, with very, very few decals used. Being properly applied paint, the bodies I paint last longer then bodies that are done with paint and decals. </p>
    <p>Below are a few of my recently completed bodies, enjoy! Click on Galleries to see many more bodies I have painted.</p>
